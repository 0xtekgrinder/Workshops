# Setup

## 1. Go

In this workshop, we will create an HTTP REST server using Go.
First of all, make sure you have **Go 1.14** or higher installed, allowing you to use the Gin Web Framework.

You can install **Go** following this [link](https://go.dev/doc/install).

If you have the right version installed, you should have something similar:
```shell
go version
> go version go1.18.2 linux/amd64 # OK
```

> The language should NOT be an issue in this workshop, if you're struggling with Go, do not hesitate to ask for help !

## 2. Postman

We will be using `postman` to test out our routes.

⚠️ you should not install it with snap because it's not updated on this package manager. ⚠️
