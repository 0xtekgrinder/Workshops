# Get Started with Cutter

This workshop aims to make you use the basic features of [Cutter](https://cutter.re). Cutter is a GUI for Radare2, but it provides a lot of features which are really useful for your reverse engineering tasks:
* fast patching
* ghidra integration for complete decompilation
* a useful scripting API
* nice widgets to quicky see the general information of the binary, the imports and the strings
* a useful graph view

Discover and install Cutter [here](https://cutter.re).
