* understand https
* extract data from gsm communications
* extract data from tcp communications
* use paquet analysis for usb communications
* extract data from ????
* use wireshark in a real forensic scenario

## :microscope: workshop-steganography

Basics of steganography, you will be introduced to basics of files extraction, stegsolve, and learn to hide and extract:
* data in text
* data in images
* data in sound

## :lock: workshop-cryptography

Introduction to cryptography
You will learn to:
* use base64 encoding
* learn what is a hash

* manipulate and exploit historical breaches in JWT

## :gear: workshop-reverse

Introduction to reverse engineering with Ghidra tool, you'll learn to:
* How and Why Reverse Engineering
* Decompile a binary
* Learn to use Ghidra GUI to be more efficient during your decompilation
* Solve crackmes and basic CTF challenges
* Learn to patch binary with Ghidra

## :angry: workshop-angr

Following the reverse workshop, we continue exploring reverse engineering tools
with Angr, a python framework for symbolic execution. We explore the concepts of:
* Symbolic execution, along with find and avoid conditions.
* Symbolic data, with stack, registers and static memory.

## :syringe: workshop-xss

You will learn to detect and exploit a Cross-site scripting Injection (XSS).
*  Exploit and detect basic XSS

*  Craft your own XSS payloads to bypass custom filters
*  Learn about mutation XSS and exploit a recent Chromium Breach

## :bomb: workshop-sql-injection

Introduction to SQL injection.
*  Learn to detect and exploit vulnerable websites
*  Learn to bypass weak security protections
*  Realize a blind sql injection
*  Exploit a CVE on Sequelize

## :computer: workshop-system

You will learn to detect and exploit bad configurations in Unix systems.
Part of the exercices are also what we call pyjail (aka restricted python interpreters).
Your goal in each step is to get a shell with higher rights than yours.

## :repeat: workshop-forensic

Forensic is all the techniques you can use to evaluate the consequences of an attack.
In this workshop, we will use volatility tool to learn to analyze an infected memory dump.
