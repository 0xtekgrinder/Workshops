## :wrench: Setup

Please follow the instructions on your [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.

## :hand_over_mouth: Step 1 - Easy level
> :bulb: Those challenges are here to introduce to you the [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.21/) language and the
basic concepts of a smart contract and its related data.

### [Hello Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x4E73b858fD5D7A5fc1c3455061dE52a53F35d966)
This one is quite simple, and the instructions are very explicit ; it has the purpose to introduce you
to the utils you're going to need to solve the challenges on ethernaut.

### [Fallback](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0x9CB391dbcD447E645D6Cb55dE6ca23164130D008)
This challenge introduce you to the fallback security breach as well as Solidity [Smart Contract](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.24/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) good practices !

### [Coin Flip](https://ropsten.ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xef9B87A4666fA565f9Be9b14fE6A34037caDCF16)
It's going to introduce you to the basic random number generator security breach.

## :cry: Step 2 - Medium Level

> :bulb: Here, you are really going to start practicing the Solidity language !

### [Gatekeeper One](https://ropsten.ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xfe1B0cb67F95Ab51e9052e70424A49A6d34769ed)
This challenge will introduce you to the `gasleft` function, and the conversion between types.
You will have to code yourself a smart contract to exploit it !

### [Force](https://ropsten.ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xC624F5f9cd437ca9cefeF7672F3e951b2B27A42b)
For this challenge, you're going to need a lot of *perseverance*, and  it's going to help you understand a bit more the
complex smart contracts.

### [Vault](https://ropsten.ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/level/0xe2F72aa61fD6322C6c4d22227a594391E051F990)
This challenge will help you understand how bigger Smart Contracts are, how does `flashloan` works the potential exploit in it.

> :bulb: No resources here because in each challenge the website already provides them !

## :skull_and_crossbones: Step 3 - Hard Level

> :bulb: Those challenges will introduce you to how the variables are stored in the Ethereum blockchain.
