# Workshop 2 - Smart Shop.

During this workshop, you will create a decentralized online shop.
You probably have heard about "Le bon coin", a purchasing site for individuals to individuals.

Your goal is to write a smart contract that reproduce some basic features of this platform,
including the ability to :

- Submit a product for sale
- Pay for a product

## Step 0 : Initialization

You can use the code editor of your choice, but we highly recommend using the online Remix Editor available [here](https://remix.ethereum.org).

It has all required features for smart contract development :
- A builtin Solidity compiler
- A local ethereum network with 10 accounts already funded with 100 Ether

## Step 1 : A product

First and because each one of them is different, you must create an abstraction of a product.
It must contain basic fields such as :
- The product name
- The product price
- The product owner's account address
- An optional description (with a maximum of 500 char)

The contract must contain a global list of all the products submitted by the users.
It has to be accessible to anyone.

## Step 2 : Submit for sale


## Step 3 : Pay
