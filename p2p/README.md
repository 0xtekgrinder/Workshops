# Workshop - Foundry

In this workshop you will learn how to use foundry's tools to: 


:heavy_check_mark: create a solidity developement environnement.

:heavy_check_mark: tests your smart-contracts.

:heavy_check_mark: deploy and interract with your contracts on a local or test network.

## Step 0: Initialization

${SETUP}
`forge init workshop --no-commit`

## Step 1: 

First of all:
- Add a constructor to set a default value of `number`.
- Modify the increment function to make it increase tha value of `number` by the value passed as an argument.

Now test your function by modifying the `test/Counter.t.sol` file, the file must test the increment function and the setNumber one.

now test with `forge test` at the root of your repo.

## Step 2:

For the step we'll use the `anvil` command to start a local test blockchain.

Now you will:

- Deploy your contract on the local blockchain.
> add doc

- Call the contract to query the value of `number`
> add doc

- Call the contract to set the value of `number` to 4242
> add doc

## Step 3:

In this step you're going to deploy your contract. To explain a bit what is behind, a solidity smart contract is not only code, a bit like in a software there are a few parts that underlie it. The first one is the ABI (Application Binary Interface) which is a JSON file that contains the signature of your functions and variables. You can view it using `forge inspect Counter abi`. It helps anyone understand how to interact with your smart contract without having the code. The second one is the bytecode which is the compiled version of your code a bit like machine language. It is the code that will be executed on the blockchain.

When you want to interact with a blockchain you are going to use what is called a JSON-RPC. It is a protocol of data interaction that was first created by Google and uses json for the data format. All the ethereum clients use this type of protocol to interact with other peers.

Now create a `Contract.sol` file and add the following contract to it.
```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Random {
    uint256 private rand;

    constructor() {
        rand = uint256(blockhash(block.number-1));
    }

    function guess(uint256 _number) public view returns(bool) {
        require(_number == rand, "It is not the right number, try again. :)");
        return true;
    }
}
```

Now deploy and interract with the storage of the `random` contract to determine the value of `rand`.

When you think it's done you can try it by calling the `guess()` function with your number as an arg, if it is the good one this will return `true`.

## Step 4:

For this step we will interract with a testnets. A testnet is a blockchain that is used to test smart contracts and dapps. It is close to the mainnet but with the main difference being that it is not used to store real value.

So you will need to create a wallet.
> add doc
And claim some goerli's faucets.
> add doc

Using `infura` you can host a node and connect to it by the given RPC url.
> add doc

Now deploy your contracts on the goerli testnets and interract with it !
